The #MondayWrap is up: Fisher addresses LT Robinson, Goff's progress on Sunday, and the Rams' current record. 
https://t.co/U4EJX8Vuvz
@Cmcys007 You can watch it on the Rams‚Äô Facebook page. I don‚Äôt know when it will be on the weibsite. Sooner than later.
"There's a good chance he'll be the starting tackle this week." Fisher on Robinson.
Fisher: "I expect Greg (Robinson) to be back and ready to roll. I had a good conversation with him today‚Äîhe‚Äôs focused and he needed a break"
Fisher's Monday press conference slated to begin in about five minutes...

@RockStar_Rams nice as it would be, that's college football. Pretty incomparable atmosphere to the pros.
#Rams snap counts from #LAvsNO. Offense, defense, special teams. https://t.co/fSyJnnr0NL
Thinking about those at Ohio State this morning. Wishing the victims and their families and friends peace and a fast recovery.
@kayyepeee exactly! It was üöÆ. 

Ps come back to LA soon
@kayyepeee cause third book sucked
@ChrisDemirdjian very kind of you to say, thank you, Chris.

Fisher also said, "I would expect Greg to return back to the lineup." So this could just be a one-week thing, especially with Saffold injury
Fisher said he gave LT Greg Robinson "a break ... because he needed it." Cited too many penalties, mental errors as factors for why.
Final team stats from #LAvsNO. Rams allowed 555 yards of offense to Saints. https://t.co/6r7cFgqM5V
A Malcom Brown carry will end it. Saints win 49-21. The Rams are now 4-7 on the season. Instant recap up soon.

McCarthy said "Bakooka" is the name of the option play #Packers QB Aaron Rodgers ran Monday night. "We're looking to get the pitch there."
McCarthy on #Packers: "We've been through a period of adversity, which will make us stronger as a football team as we move forward."
McCarthy said #Packers CB Damarious Randall "did a lot of good things" in return from groin injury. "It was definitely taxing for him."
#Packers coach Mike McCarthy said he doesn't have any medical update on Aaron Rodgers' hamstring.
Inside "most gratifying" drive of an ungratifying fall. How one possession, at least for now, saved #Packers season. https://t.co/KNaZTuKigr
Nelson came clean on late 4th down offensive pass interference wasn't called: "I probably pushed off quite a bit, to be honest with you."
Jordy Nelson on #Packers final drive vs. Eagles: "It‚Äôs the 4th quarter of a big-time game on Monday night. You don‚Äôt need a rah-rah speech.‚Äù
Could #Packers fullback Aaron Ripkowski attain folk here status in Green Bay? He seems well on his way. https://t.co/DrEaoiUMob
One memory last night: The smile Aaron Rodgers and Julius Peppers had as they shared high 5 in locker room. Even vets knew it was huge win.
It was flawed. Ugly. Ultimately beautiful. Go inside 17-play drive that, at least for now, saved #Packers' season. https://t.co/KNaZTv1TF1
#Packers QB Aaron Rodgers said he had to "drop my drawers" to get taped up, didn't want to do that on national TV. Hence, the sideline tent.
Hard-hitting news here: #Packers FB Aaron Ripkowski says his TD spike wasn't premeditated. Teammates told him to spike it. He obliged.
Final: #Packers 27, Eagles 13. GB snaps a 4-game losing streak, improves to 5-6. Saves their season ... for now.
That 17-play, 78-yard drive took 8:21. Started at #Packers 8, ended with Mason Crosby field goal and 27-13 lead. Drive of the season.
#Packers are 10-13 on third down tonight, and now 1-1 on fourth down. It's why they're about to snap their 4-game losing streak.
There were more than 10 minutes left when #Packers got possession inside their 10-yard line. Now 3:20 left. What a game-clinching drive.
Aaron Rodgers could not have thrown that any better. He's been a different passer tonight.
Jeff Janis called for a holding penalty on a punt return that had no return. Not good.
That was Clay Matthews' first sack since Oct. 9 vs. Giants. Of course, he missed 4 games with hamstring injury. Still, been awhile.
Aaron Ripkowski's first career TD provides a 24-13 lead in 4th quarter. OK, #Packers fans, time for you to come up with a new FB chant.

Newton: "We have to come together and find a way to win these close games."

Panthers have lost 5 games by three or fewer points.
Cam Newton on the first half: "Unacceptable."
Rivera said he was tempted to go for it on 4th-and-1. But with time left and 3 timeouts, ultimately opted against it.
Kelvin: "They hit us with everything they had in the first half but we came back fighting. We lost, and we have to go back to grinding."
Greg Olsen: "Just have to make the plays, starting with me."
Rivera: "There are no moral victories, that's the truth of the matter."
After not getting anything done in the first half, Rivera said he appreciated the effort to claw back. Just didn't do enough.
Newton sacked to end the game on fourth down.
Newton calls the last timeout ahead of 3rd-and-10 with 1:05 left.
Two big plays to Crabtree and Raiders are in the red zone.
Kelvin Benjamin is a yard short on 3rd-and-10 and Panthers will punt.
Gradkowski doubtful.
Ted Ginn taking his game to another level today.
Roberts hangs on through contact for the 2-point conversion. 32-32 with 8:37 left.

@ChuckMills6 I haven't seen it and I haven't seen the national media cite another team doing it. But not sure.
Harbaugh said that Rick Wagner has played his two best games of the year back-to-back.
Harbaugh said that CB Jimmy Smith has been running. Ran Saturday. Didn't feel ready to go. "He's close," Harbaugh said.
Harbaugh said the planned safety to end the game in pretty much in every special teams coaches repertoire. "It isn't revolutionary."
Harbaugh: "We're not going to be exclusively a no-huddle team. That will take us down a road that will create problems for us."
Harbaugh said that ZaDarius Smith was victim of number's game. Also said Smith has been outplayed by rookie Matt Judon recently.
@DeauxRaeMe_ I think he should play more on defense, too.
Harbaugh on Flacco's sliding: "We all played baseball. You can't do a pop-up slide on a knee brace. It's as simple as that."
@TwiTati Yes, which is what he's saying.
@DeauxRaeMe_ Doesn't seem to be case at this point, given he hasn't played much lately with the DB injuries they've had.

Does Fletcher Cox think his roughing the passer was a penalty? "Absolutely not."

#Titans add CB D'Joun Smith, a former third round pick of the #Colts, to their practice squad.
Mike Mularkey said Perrish Cox's inconsistency led to his release by #Titans. https://t.co/NFEhCX0CiF
Mularkey: We have to get over .500. We haven't been over .500 in my time here, except for when we have been 1-0.
Mularkey said Sunday was one of Wesley Woodyard's best games of the season.
Mularkey said coverage had to get better and the timing of blitzes could have been better late in the ballgame.
Mularkey did say Matt Barkley got the ball out quickly and made decent throws downfield.
Mularkey said #Titans played softer coverage with a 20-point lead.
Mularkey tells #Titans players to be smart with their time off.
Mularkey said he agrees that Taylor Lewan is a target because of his reputation.
Mularkey said Austin Johnson did some good things, was active in part over Blackson because #Titans wanted a bigger body.
Mularkey reiterated that Kevin Dodd's sense of urgency in practice needs to improve. Inactive 2 weeks in a row.
Mularkey said #Titans have discussed using Derrick Henry in more short yardage situations.
DeMarco Murray should benefit from week off, says Mularkey
Kendall Wright was back as the deep man on returns at end of game because #Titans were expecting onside kick, but didn't happen.
Mularkey said this is an opportunity for LeShaun Sims and Kalan Reed will get chance maybe they weren't necessarily expecting.
Mularkey: I think Cox has shown over the last few weeks that he hasn't played consistently.
Mularkey said a rotation will probably ensue at that cornerback position for now.
Mularkey: I thought LeShaun Sims did some good things yesterday. I thought Valentino Blake did some good things too.

Darian Stewart said part of the decision to re-sign was to play with a defensive core that will be together ... "they're like my brothers."
Stewart said when he went undrafted in 2010, the late Kenny McKinley, a friend of his, called him, trying to convince him to come to Denver.
Darian Stewart: "It's not always about the money. I love wining. I love everything we have with this organization."
DBs coach Joe Woods says that Darian Stewart does a "great job" with young players, helping them study film ... "a great surprise for us."
DBs coach Joe Woods, on Darian Stewart: "He brought great leadership, a different style to the way we played."
Jordan Norwood said he talked with Aqib Talib this morning ... no lingering animus; everyone has moved on.

Kubiak: "I"m not worried about the stretch run. I'm worried about Jacksonville."
Kubiak said he disagrees w/ notion that Fowler was better served by going down before the goal line, saying, "Lot of football left to play."
Kubiak: Booker "improved" at breaking tackles Sunday night ... "I think he is getting better ... made some plays catching the ball."
Kubiak: right tackle "has been an issue throughout the year from an injury standpoint," hopes Stephenson can build off his play last night.
Kubiak, on A.J. Derby: "Excited about his development ... makes a lot of plays ... catches the ball well ... improving [his] blocking."
Kubiak said on the game-tying drive, defense called "pretty much the same stuff," and D got aggressive on blitzing in OT.
Kubiak: "I tell our players all the time, 'We battle together.'" Isn't happy with Talib's shove, but talks about players' competitiveness.
Kubiak, on Talib shoving Norwood: "I see guys competing, guys are upset ... Jordan &amp; Aqib are fine. That's not an issue."

@ChurchService oh, sorry. I thought you were following up on an Ingram comment. Jerry. Never mind.
@Joeycous1 That's something I could better answer in January. Know this: players want him back.
Texans OLB Mercilus faced Chargers as rookie in 2012. Hugely improved Sun. Top defensive performer v. Chargers. Ex-teammate of Liuget.
Monday's announcement on new San Diego supervisor was not good news for Spanoses &amp; Chargers in stadium game. https://t.co/i4KvPGjhbO
@ChurchService Early in his career, I would agree with you. From 2015 through today, he's done a nice job. No games missed.
Tough to evaluate Attaochu's season. Injury detours. Good burst. In pass coverage Sun., knocked Texans No. 1 WR Hopkins down.
Chargers OLB Melvin Ingram is disruptive. Having his most complete season (yr 5). Brings a lot of energy. Finishing plays isn't a strength.
Melvin Ingram and Bosa are working well together. Lots of enthusiasm for each other's play, too. A build-around tandem for Chargers.
@dvdv307 Injured, yes. Is third round a "premium" pick? Answer is subjective, of course, but I don't think so.
Multiple injuries have set back a few of Chargers premium draft investments under Spanos/Telesco. Te'o. Verrett. Attaochu. Perryman.
Rough third season for Attaochu. Injuries. Emanuel had moved ahead of him. Great worker. Explosive. Rookie OLB Land‚Ä¶ https://t.co/6egEnwV68Y
@opaztec7156 Agree on B.O.
Chargers safety Addae. DBs Hayward, Lowery said his return had a big impact on D. Energy. Hayward said play of whole defense "spiked."
Chargers CB Hayward said Bosa somewhat reminds him of Texans star J.J. Watt. Has some of that "dog" in him. Mentality. Enthusiasm
Will be interesting to see how many diehard season ticket holders renew their tickets despite another losing season.
Jags, though, still have diehards despite losing streak. Households watching dropped only from 139,000 last week to 135,000 for Bills game.
UF-FSU topped Jags in TV ratings in Jax -- 147,000 households to 135,000 households.
YES https://t.co/mYJWXeMuoc
Still Jags could face challenging marketing job in off season although off season changes might give them a boost.
Season ticket holders tend to get frustrated late in another losing season but could get back on board in off season.
Season ticket sales next year will interesting. Some long time season ticket holders saying they won't renew but could change mind later.
Houston game a week ago watched in 128,000 households. Last road game in KC two weeks ago watched in 136,000 households.
Despite four game losing streak, number of households watching jags-lions was watched in139,000 households. Opener watched in 189,000.
Safe to say that the Jags have a diehard audience of just under 140,000 households in Jax.
Jags had 189,000 TV  households for Green bay opener when expectations were high. They nosedived next week and never recovered.
Jags TV  ratings only took slight dip from 136,000 households last week to 128,000 for Texans game. Diehard fans still watching.
@GI_JoeK also says "Time for a big name and big regime change.'' Sounds like a popular sentiment these days.
Got a tweet from @GI.JoeK saying he isn't going to Jags game and isn't giving away his tickets. Are most season tickets holders going?
If ratings decline for Pats-Seahawks, there is a problem. Last year, Sunday nite game for 10th week was Arizona at  Seattle.
One of the season's premier matches is set for Sunday night in prime time -- Super Bowl rematch of Pats-Seahawks.
With the election and World Series over, we may find out Sunday if the  NFL has a rating problem or first half was just a blip.
Old saying that Rome wasn't built in a day may apply to Jags.
In 2012 both KC and Jags were 2-14. KC has rebuilt and is 6-2 Jags still rebuilding  at 2-6.
In 2013 Houston was 2-14 and lost to 4-12 Jags twice. Houston has rebounded and Jags still rebuilding.

While parking outside of Raymond James Stadium Sunday, I ran into the Ali Marpet clan, enjoying a tailgate party. Kid comes from good stock
Among the many Tampa Bay fans in attendance Sunday was Mr. Joe Maddon, cheering the Bucs on from sweet vantage point in the GM suite
Bucs GM Jason Licht has to feel mighty proud of disciple Jon Robinson, who is doing a heck of a job overhauling the Tennessee Titans
In 2012 &amp; 2015, the Bucs had an opportunity to be in the playoff conversation through December. Instead, they folded. It's about the finish
@RHeightsFinest @CourtneeHendrix Haven't seen many drops this year, but I have seen 10 TD catches.
@fonz33770 Only you could inject a Castro reference, buddy
After Sunday's dynamic effort, the Buc defense is allowing only a 34 pct. conversion rate on third down. Only Miami is stingier at 33 pct.
How dominant has Mike Evans been? He has generated 62 first downs in 73 catches. Antonio Brown's a distant 2nd among WRs with 50 first downs
@LukeEasterling Right on, Luke
@SABmetrics Agreed. Winston's passion for the game is genuine and inspiring.
Right from the start, the Bucs made the Seahawks look like the Bears Sunday. Here's how they did it.

Jordan Clarkson's analysis: "I shot like butt tonight."
Just saw Nick Young walk out of the arena. He has a boot on the right foot. Not using crutches.
Young is able to put pressure on his right foot now which is a very good sign.
Nick Young was still in full uniform when the locker room opened. Seems to be in pretty good spirits, given the situation.
Luke Walton says when Nick Young went down it "kind of stunned us a little bit."
Lakers lose 105-88. Anthony Davis scores 41 points. Lakers start their four-game trip with a loss and an injury to Nick Young.
Pelicans lead Lakers 89-63 after three quarters.  Anthony Davis has 35 points. This one hasn't been competitive.
Julius Randle has a double-double with 12 points, 10 rebounds. Timofey Mozgov is close with 10 points, 9 rebounds.
The MRI will confirm the extent of the injury, which will then reveal recovery time. https://t.co/rtKzAu6AI4
Depends on how severe the tear is. https://t.co/f5XEOUkN6a
Lakers trail the Pelicans 65-41at halftime. Anthony Davis has 20 points, Jrue Holiday has 12. No Laker in double figures.
A strained Achilles is often a partial tear, which can heal without surgery. Lakers say Nick Young has a strained right Achilles.
Nick Young has a right achilles strain. He'll have an MRI tomorrow and is out of the game.
Young missed a game last week with a sprained toe in his left foot. This injury was to his right foot or ankle. Appeared to be non-contact
RT @dougherty_jesse: Couldn't put weight on his right leg. Young's previous injury was to his left toe, so it's seemingly not related. http‚Ä¶

Doug Pederson said still no decision on whether Nelson Agholor will play against CIN. ...Hard to understand why they'd still sit him.
...And how the Eagles are playing so many young players. He's not wrong, either. And from a 30K-ft view, development of Wentz is priority
It's understandable given they're 5-6. But it is a noticeable shift. Pederson's message was to look at how teams like SEA, OAK developed
Doug Pederson's message is starting to change. For awhile, it was how special this team could be. Now, it's much more long-term outlook.

Not defending the defense, but Eagles offense hasn't scored more than 24 points since Week 3. Hard to beat GB scoring 13 points.
DGB on Agholor: "...We just kind of were just going with what was given. We could have used him. We didn't have too many receivers."
Wentz said he found out Sunday Agholor wouldn't play. Wasn't sure what would hapen. Saw Turner get more reps in practice.
Wentz on his INT: "It just sailed on me." Why are they sailing on him?: "Bad throw."
Pederson on Wentz: "I think it was a good performance. ...He stayed calm. He stayed right on point. He played pretty well."

Bears' improbable comeback attempt falls short in 27-21 loss to Titans. The roundup from Sunday's disappointment: https://t.co/1KhjeokFMp
Bears had 10 drops today via our count, including two in the end zone on potential game-winning drive.
Bears on the doorstep of a ridiculous comeback here. First-and-goal at the 7. Matt Barkley three completions to Wilson for 58 yds.
Barkley in the fourth: 15-for-25, 152 yards, two TDs. Receivers with four drops.
It's all relative, yes. But Matt Barkley has put together a solid fourth quarter today as Bears rally.
Titans have 348 total yards through three quarters. They've got first down from the Bears 14 to start the 4th.
The Bears Monster Squad still gets pretty hype to fire these T-shirts into the stands. No quit in that crew.
Jordan Howard has 70 rushing yards today. His bid for 100 may be the only thing left worth watching.

Marcus Cannon was scheduled for unrestricted free agency after season. Offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia has loved him for years.

@BrandonFicara Yeah, it doesn't look like this is the year. But hey, Wentz could change that.
@BrandonFicara Can't argue with the return. And having 2 vets ahead of Wentz never really made sense. Watching Wentz makes 2016 worth it.
@BrandonFicara I think it's pretty standard. Usually, all this happens behind the scenes. Seems drawn out because the story leaked.

Per @fboutsiders research, I believe this breaks a streak of 98 straight games in which Seahawks led or were within one score in the 4th Q.
Seahawks' 10 offensive possessions vs. the Bucs: 7 punts, 2 turnovers and a field goal.
That's eight straight possessions where the Seahawks' defense has not allowed any points.

Crossbar, post, out. No goal
I don't think this one counts
#CBJ has a half a Hab night going. It's 5-0 on Gagner goal
Sometimes shots on goal do reflect game. Tonight's a great case. 37-19 with 7:52 left in 4-0 #CBJ lead.
First time Vasilevskiy has allowed 4 goals in regulation this year. Entered game leading league in GAA (1.50) and Save percentage (.951).
On Friday, Jon Cooper said tough thing about #CBJ is their balance, no one line to check. Wennberg line killed em Fri. Karlsson line tonite.
Just the second multiple-point game in career for Anderson. Went 2-1-3 in rout of Habs.
Three-point night for Josh Anderson. #CBJ
Scott Hartnell, 4-0. Beautiful passing sequence from Anderson to Savard to Hartnell.
#CBJ have been physical, but many awesome stick checks to take away cross-ice feeds.
Killorn nicks crossbar on breakaway. Still 3-0
#CBJ 3-0. Anderson goal. Assists from Hartnell and Nutivaara. Anderson w/ goals in both games vs. Bolts.
Anderson playing like the Lightning insulted seven generations of his ancestors. He's hammering everyone in white.
Kucherov is so fun to watch. Would have looked right at home on those Red Wings' teams in the late 90s and 00s.

Kaepernick's last-second run comes up a yard short. Niners lose a franchise-record 10th straight 31-24.
So Niners will have a shot at the end zone from Miami's 6 with 5 seconds left.
Play under review. Sure looks like Kerley got his feet down.
Niners have it at Miami's 24 with 11 seconds left. Enough time for a couple shots at the end zone.

@TheREAL_Farley If your concern is about lack of attention, I addressed Johnson here today: https://t.co/XeiqTPxk9n

#Bears expected to sign TE Justin Perillo to practice squad. Played in 9 games for #Packers this season and 20 since 2014. Played at Maine.
#Bears had 6 players in for tryouts: TEs Kivon Cartwright, JP Holtz &amp; Justin Perillo, LBs John Lotulelei &amp; Wynton McManis &amp; S Justin Currie
And Mostert was signed to #49ers practice squad.
#49ers sign RB Raheem Mostert, who had been on #Bears practice squad/injured list. Has return ability.
For those asking if #Bears 15 players on injured reserve is record, no. Most for franchise in 2000s. NYG had 22 in '14. BAL 20 in '15.
